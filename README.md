About our project 

    HEART ATTACK ML PROJECTOR
    
    Heart disease is the major cause of death, nowadays. It accounts for more deaths annually than any other cause. According to the WHO,  deaths from heart disease represent 31% of all global deaths. 
Of all heart diseases, coronary heart disease (aka heart attack) is the most common and the most fatal. 
The silver lining is that heart attacks are highly preventable and simple lifestyle modifications coupled with early treatment greatly improve its threats. It is, however, difficult to identify high-risk patients because of the multi-factorial nature of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, etc.. This is where machine learning and data mining come to the rescue.
Doctors and scientists alike have turned to machine learning (ML) techniques to develop screening tools and this is because of their superiority in pattern recognition and classification as compared to other traditional statistical approaches.
